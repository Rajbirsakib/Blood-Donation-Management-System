## Introduction
A Blood Donation Management System is a web-based platform to efficiently manage the process of blood donation including the collection, storage and distribution of blood. The system helps streamline the coordination between blood banks, donors, patients and hospitals by automating key processes such as donor registration, blood inventory management and tracking of blood requests. This increases blood flow and speeds up supply, improves communication with the donor community, minimizes human errors. By providing real time data on blood availability, the system ensures that hospitals, donors and patients can access the blood they need in a timely manner, ultimately contributing to life-saving medical treatments.
